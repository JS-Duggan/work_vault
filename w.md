### Selecting Sites and Time Range

##### Date Range

In the top right corner of the page, there is a clock icon next to the words 'Last 7 days' by 
selecting this, you are able to adjust the date range that is displayed in the data. There are a 
few pre-select options on the right, and a manual time range selector on the left. The default option is past 7 days.

### Visualisations

##### Summary of Visitor Movements

The summary of the selected period provides insight into detections made. It is useful in determining how many visitors have used the park recently, how many visitors are returning to the park, and how it compares to the last period.

##### Find when Guests are Visiting

Also seen on the dashboard is a section dedicated to analysing when visitors come to the 
park, and how long they stayed. 'Visitation Breakdown over Time' is used to show the number of visits over and under five minutes in length at each site, mapping both the number of visits and their engagement time with the course. Included in this graph is the temperature and rainfall data in the same time period, enabling an easy analysis on visitor numbers based on the  weather. For example, you can see The Visitor Detections over 5 minutes in green, under 5 minutes in yellow, rainfall in blue, and temperature in orange.

A further Breakdown of when detections are made is visualised in the form of a heat map on the dashboard. 'The Detections by Time' heat map shows a breakdown of detectios made by hour of day, and day of the week.  Moing from left to right, you can see the hour of day that the data relates to, and moving from top to bottom is the day of the week.  Using the snapshot below, the data shows us that there was heavy visitation for 17:00 on Friday and 19:00 on Saturday.  This shows you what periods of a week are typically like, lighter sqaures indicating lower visitations on average, and dark squares showing heavier traffic.  It's important to note that this represents 'new visitors for that hour', not the total visitors at site

##### Find how long Guests are Staying

Below the visitation breakdown is the dwell time section. This sections shows the relative percentages of counts of usage times for parks, as well as the average usage time, or 'Dwell Time'. Below we can see that 30.9% of users stayed between 5 and 10 minutes.

##### Summaries

On the left of the dashboard, there are also a few panels dedicated to summarising the data presented on graphs. From here you can easily learn how many visitors there were to the park, and what the most popular times to visit are.

##### Monthly Comparisons

At the bottom of the dashboard, the ability to compare key metrics by month is available. detections made and average dwell time is shown on a month-month basis to look at changes over time at a larger scale. We can see on the graph below that the average dwell time in November is 11.1 minutes
