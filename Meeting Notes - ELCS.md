Meeting 1 
- Tactical brief of meeting
- Gary:
	- some of the zone do not make sense
	- hours do not match demand
	- unlikely and impossible trip have demand
	- expect some distribution of trips in red areas
- use agent file to map origin destination pairs
- ensure that zones outside of warringah Fwy. do not see 
- each detector data formatted as per Gary 
- look through mappings and 
- include gantry 9 information
- make o/d matrix using compass IOT data

- priority order is:
	- Use Agent files to map O/D Pairs
	- SCATS only
	- SCATS + Gantry 9
	- Infilling of missing trips
	- CompassIOT


Meeting 2
	- use hour-by hour basis to calculate gravity coefficients
	- Gary seems to be taking mega-manual approach
		- suggests to do everything by inspection
	- intersections that do not have a detector between them are showing as 0
	- median approach not great for Syd
	- make a comparison between Median and hour-by-hour approach
	- missing data from 332 substituted by survey data
	-
