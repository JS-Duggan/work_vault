When registering a device into the database, another user should be able to understand the key information about it from just the name. Ensuring that consistent practices are used when naming devices will make it easier for engineers to assist with or enter running and complete projects. 

Use the following rules to name devices in the future:

## 1.
Break out and identify the device type, client it is in use for, and location. For example, if I had an Edge being sent to monitor Fulton Hogan plants in Dunedin, I would have:
> **_Device + Client + Location_**
> **Edge + Fulton Hogan + Dunedin**

## 2.
Create a unique identifier code for each aspect of the device name, with a maximum of three characters for clarity. Following along from above, I would shorten to:
> **Edg + FH + Dun**

> [!tip]
> Other projects may have already used an identifier or property you plan to use, check to make sure that if the properties are the same, so are the identifiers, otherwise they should be unique.
## 3. 
Finally, concatenate the three terms using hyphens (-), and make all characters lowercase.
> **edg-fh-dun**

Following this will result in a clear and easy to search and understand name for devices in the table.
