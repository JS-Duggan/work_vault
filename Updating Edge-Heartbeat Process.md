## North Adelaide Golf Course Visitor Analytics

### Selecting Sites and Time Range
In the top right corner of the page, there is a clock icon next to the words 'Last 7 days' by selecting this, you are able to adjust the date range that is displayed in the data. There are a few pre-select options on the right, and a manual time range selector on the left.  

On the top left of the page, above the title card, there is a box labelled 'sites' with a drop down menu next to it. From here you can select which devices you would like to see data from. 

Both of these options have defaults and will reset each time you visit the page, to all sites selected and a 7 day time range. 


### Visualisations
#### Path Analytics
The path analytics counts the number of times the same device is detected at two consecutive locations. The count is the number of times individual detections occurred between the two sites, and average transit time is how much time was spent between the origin and the destination.

#### Sites by Detections
This map shows the location of each devive, and the circle size and colour represents the total number of detections made at each site. 

#### Visitor Breakdown over Time
This graph shows the total number of detections from selected devices over the selected time period. These detections are grouped into two parts; Detections where the device was inside the detection radius for greater than five minutes, and detections where they left before five minutes. 

#### Total Percentage of Course Visits by Hour of Day and Day of Week
The first chart shows the percentage of the total detections made in a day made each hour of the day. The second shows the percentage of total detections made over a week that occurred on each day. 

#### Device Detections / Average Dwell Time by Month
These graphs show the amount of total detections made in the past month, as well as the average amount of time any one detection has stayed at a single site.
