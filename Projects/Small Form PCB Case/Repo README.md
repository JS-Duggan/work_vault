# Small Form PCB Case

## Description
This model is a DIN rail compatible case for small size PCBs (roughly 42mm x 42mm). The case is a two-part assembly, with a lid and base. The lid can be attached and holds without additional materials, but has holes to secure lid with an M4 screw and nutsert. 

## How To Use
To print the model, download the .stl files, found in '/printable files', and use directly. To edit the model, download the .step files. found in '/project files'. .step files are Autodesk Fusion project files, and this software may be required to edit them. The files include the base, lid and also the DIN clip, which can be imported into other projects as a useful component to enable DIN compatibility. If you plan to scale the model, ensure that the dimensions of the DIN clip are not changed, this can be done by editing the project files, removing the clip from the base, scaling the case as needed, and then re-importing the clip and re-joining.

Model has been printed in ABS, which is recommended. Stiffer materials may make it difficult to clip and un-clip from rails, as it is a right fit. 

When assembling, using a nutsert with a large or medium flange is recommended, as small flanges will not provide enough support to prevent the nutsert from being pulled inside the cutout. The DIN clip has a protrusion to lever the clip open with a flathead screwdriver or similar implement for easy removal from rails.
