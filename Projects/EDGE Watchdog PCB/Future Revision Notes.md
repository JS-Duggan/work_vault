* Find way to make PCB same width as EDGE, will look less clunky
	* ditch LED's
	* move RJ45 port closer to pico
* potentially make PCB double sided. Gives more flexibility in adding modules
* use less power on LED's by increasing resistance - testing needed.
* work on thermal disspiation issue (could be hoardwrae related or software)
* look into why linear rectifier works, and others don't. 
* fix footrpint / part # for linear rectifier
* check static compoilation of QT file
* build debs using CI pipeline
* add test points to pcb
