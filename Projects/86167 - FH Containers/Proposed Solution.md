## System Characteristics
---
1. Use pole mounted thermal imaging cameras to support optimal (even) heating of containers storing bitumen.
2. detect and leakages (boil-over) or spillage that may have occurred during the heating process

## Topology
---
- **Cameras:** One thermal camera installed onsite, mounted to have a view of the side profile of a single bitutainer. 
- **Enclosure:** SAGE built and supplied power enclosure that contains all processing power needed to analyse video feeds, and supply power to existing heat control PLCs
- **CCTV Monitor and Recorder:** 1x 32 inch LED monitor, and 1x Network Video Recorder for displaying live and historical views of the thermal cameras.
- **Cabling:** Hardwired ethernet cabling from each heating control PLC, routed through SAGE Edge in new enclosure inside power distribution container.
- **Fire Suppression:** Fire suppression tube in each power distribution container, cylinder mounted inside the room that activates when melted by high temperatures
