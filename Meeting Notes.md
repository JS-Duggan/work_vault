## ELCS Ingester


- end goal is to produce a trips file
- get traffic model for full site
- TRIPS
	- Name (ID)
	- Departes (start time)
	- Type (Veh type)
	- Origin (zone)
	- Destination  (zone)
	- DNA 
		- physical aspects of the car
		- driver behavour
		- informs model on vehicle behaviour
		- bottom of priority
- define origin/destination matrix
- Traffic Profile
	- term (time period)
	- ditribution (15 min demand periods)
	- percent of vehicles
- compassIOT data is only a sample
- required to infill / scale trips
- make an assessment is to where traffic goes in a split
- gravity modelling technique
- take scats count data

- Gary wants:
	- TRIP Information
	- Checks on data so that it makes sense
	- zone distance
	- distribution of times between zones
	- speed zones

- identify where gaps are in count information
- routechoice is probably not an issue
- path of vehicle
- .csv file type
- create demand distribution
- 15 minute OD Demands
- develop a set of matricies by count
- simplified solution of demand from CompassIOT
- dont worry about DNA
