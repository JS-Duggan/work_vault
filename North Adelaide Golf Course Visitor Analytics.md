## Visualisations

#### Discovering Visitor Movements
The dashboard has a table combining data to show how visitors are moving between sites. It can be seen under 'path analytics' and is useful in determining how often visitors move between sites, and how long it usually takes them.

This data is also available to be downloaded as a .csv file by selecting the three dots in the top left corner, selecting inspect, and then 'Download CSV'. This process to download can be done for all panels on the dashboard

#### Find Where Guests Visit
The dashboard will allow you to determine the locations the most guests visit. Under the panel 'Sites by Detection', a map will display the number of detections made at each site by increasing in size and changing colours to show the percentage of total detections made at that site. This is useful to identify the most popular sites of the course

Hovering over a site will show the exact number of detections, and the site name for ease of use.

#### Find when Guests are Visiting
Also seen on the dashboard is a section dedicated to analysing when visitors come to the course, and how long they stayed. 'Visitation Breakdown over Time' is sued to show the number of visits over and under five minutes in length at each site, mapping both the number of visits and their engagement time with the course.  Below this is a graph showing the temperature and rainfall data in the same time period, enabling an easy analysis on visitor numbers based on the weather.

The dashboard will visualise the most popular time of day for visitors, and the most popular day to visit in the 'Course Visits by Hour of Day' and 'Course Visits by Day of Week'. This shows the percentage of total guests that visit at each hour of the day, and day of the week - useful for determining your peak times.

At the bottom of the page, the total detections for each month and the average dwell times for those months are displayed, allowing you to analyse how engagement trends change over longer time periods
